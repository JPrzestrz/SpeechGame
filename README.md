# SpeechGame

Repository for simple game using <b>speech recognition</b> deep learning algorithm <br>
The aim of the game is to collect coins while avoiding asteroids falling <br>
from the sky. User has possibility to choose one of two available steering <br>
options. First is the speech recognition so player can say to the microphone one <br>
of the commands: "right" or "left". The deep learning model processes the audio <br>
and makes decision whether move player to the left or right.

In the right bottom area we can see the "speech recognition" symbol which means that<br>
we are actually using this type of steering. <br><br>
The second option is the keyboard steering. User can use arrows on the keyboard to move player left or right. <br>
